Designing a RESTFUL API---------------->
Its a json based RestApi


GET/users ==== Html rendering so this is for browsers
GET/api/users===list me all my users as a json //for mobile,react,etc etc app
//i am creating  hybrid server


GET/api/users/2==== get the user with id2
GET/api/users/1==== get the user with id1
dynamic path paramters /api/users/:id (:id -----this is a variable)



POST/api/users===create a new user through postman 

PATCH/api/users/1=== edit the user with id1 (1==id)

DELETE/api/users/1===delete the user with Id 1
for above 3 ,we need postman setup
coz no way to make these req from browsers

//we have no users so we will generate and hardcode the data with 
//mockarro it creates fake data
